            Visual Studio IDE provides many features that make it easier for you to write and manage your code with confidence. For example, code quickly and accurately using IntelliSense code suggestions, make quick improvements to your code using light bulbs that suggest actions, or expand/collapse blocks of code using outlining. Organize and explore your code with the Solution Explorer that shows your code organized by files or the Class View that shows your code organized by classes.

            Console Screen usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. You can print anything on the console long by just typing console.log().
